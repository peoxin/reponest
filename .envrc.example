# Example direnv configuration for reponest development
# Copy this file to .envrc and customize as needed
#
# direnv is a shell extension that loads/unloads environment variables
# based on the current directory. See https://direnv.net/

# If using Nix flake (recommended)
use flake

# Alternative: Load environment variables from a .env file
# dotenv

# Custom environment variables for development
# export RUST_LOG=debug

# Set custom config path for testing
# export REPONEST_CONFIG="$PWD/examples/config.toml"
